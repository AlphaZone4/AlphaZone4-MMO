# AlphaZone4 Mini-MMO #

This was the 2013 AlphaZone4 April Fool's Day Joke.

This is a tiny fully working browser-based MMO framework. It's not that great, but demonstrates my abundance of free-time when AlphaZone4 was active.

Features:
* Avatar Customiser
* Multiple rooms to navigate between
* Renders world from Tiled output
* Streams in tileset images when needed by new avatar options or rooms needing new map tiles
* Basic chat support (with emojis!)
